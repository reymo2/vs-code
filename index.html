     Instructions:
     1. Make the Dough:
     In a bowl, combine warm water and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
     In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, and sugar.
     Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.
     Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth.
     Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth,
     and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.
     2. Make the Sauce:
     In a saucepan, combine crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.
     Simmer the sauce over low heat for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust seasoning to taste.
     3. Prepare the Pizza:
     Preheat your oven to its highest setting (usually around 500°F/260°C).
     Divide the dough into desired portions and roll each into a ball.
      On a floured surface, stretch and shape each ball into a thin round crust.
     Place the crusts on a pizza stone or baking sheet.
     4. Assemble and Bake:
     Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over each crust.
     Add slices of fresh mozzarella and sprinkle with fresh basil leaves.
     Drizzle a bit of olive oil over the top.
     Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes or until the crust
     is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.

     Instructions:
     1. Make the pizza dough:
     In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
     In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.
     Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth.
     Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it doubles in size.
     2. Make the pizza sauce:
     In a saucepan, combine the crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce over low heat for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
     3. Assemble the pizza:
     Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).
     Punch down the risen dough and roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness.
     Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or a baking sheet.
     Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.
     Sprinkle half of the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
     Add the sliced bell pepper, red onion, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, and fresh spinach.
     Top with the remaining mozzarella cheese.
     4. Bake the pizza:
